User Data Privacy Policy
Last Updated on November 3, 2020

The extension "Attestation covid vite fait !" collects user's data only to create local profile for the user.
By local profile we mean that the profile stays on the user's browser.
The user can delete his local profile at any time using the delete button on the extension.
The extension does not send any user information to a remote server.
